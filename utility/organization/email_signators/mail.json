  'message' : "Dear %s,\n\nYou are now officially a registered student body organization signator. As such, you are eligible to participate in this year's funding poll.\n\nSome Important Notes:\n\n1. Register your organization by going to the following url: http://sin.reed.edu/webapps/fundingpoll/my_registrations/. DO NOT FORGET TO CLICK SAVE_LIST! ADD-TO-LIST WILL NOT SAVE YOUR ORGANIZATIONS!\n\n2. You CAN use html in your blurbs and budgets (assuming you top40) but not your generic organization description (this is to simplify things for Student Activities). This is a privilege; do not abuse it. As per the by-laws I reserve the right to remove any such violations from SIN.\n\n3. Pay attention to the schedule. Funding Poll is completely automated and the schedule page shows the current mode that the system is in and thus what you can do (aka register organizations, vote, view results, etc).\n\n4. Most importantly remember that I am here to make sure this thing runs smoothly. If you run into any problems at all please do not hesitate to drop me an email and I will personally make sure that any issues that you run into are alleviated promptly. But remember I can not do this unless you communicate those issues to me first.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSincerely,\nMichael Gottesman",
