620,Chinese House,"    The Chinese Language House will turn the SU into a Beijing/Taipei-style night market to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival on Thursday, September 19 from 6-8pm. The festival is held on a full moon of the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese calendar, which falls on September 19 this year. Next to Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn Festival is considered the second most important holiday tradition, and is observed by Chinese, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese. 

Making and sharing mooncakes is one of the hallmark traditions of this festival. Another big component of this celebration is an outdoor barbecue with friends and family. We plan on having many different types of traditional Chinese food (hot pot and dim sum) along with popular street food items such as bubble milk tea, and Beijing BBQ or chuanr. The Portland Orchids Bamboo Ensemble will play traditional Chinese music in the background for the duration of this event. If weather permits, we will go outside and worship the moon by reciting poetry or singing songs while eating mooncakes, another important part of this holiday.

630,Kayam Fermentation,"Two main budget categories: capital and operations.

I tried to acquire a keg set up last semester, only came through on picking up a (supacheap) co2 tank. After a ton of craigslisting I'm opting to go commercial: F. H. Steinbarts sells everything else I need.
I should point out the keg will be mad useful for liblob booch drops as well as catering various campus events (canyon day, GF stuff, whatever).

Kombucha ingredients should last the semester. I'm aiming for 3 kegged boochdrops by Spring/Fall in addition to whatever events people want me to cater. I'm also still handing out booch mothers like candy, but that's a minor outlay.

I'm also looking to get some kombucha brewing capital for a Reedie interested in brewing large sums of kombucha, in the same fashion Brewer's Guild buys capital for Reedie brewing. The equipment will be owned by Kayam and be passed down for posterity, ever brewing kombucha for Reedies.

642,Band Practice Room,"  
The BPR is a beloved Reed institution that provides a space for members of the community to create music and form connections. Unfortunately, the PA system - a vital element of the BPR - was stolen at the beginning of the summer. This has made it difficult for many bands to practice, and in order for the BPR to serve its unique function in the Reed community we must replace it.
